API ENDPOINTS
=============

Authentication:
- POST /api/auth/login - Officer/supervisor login

Duty Management:
- PATCH /api/duties/clock-in - Clock in officer
- PATCH /api/duties/clock-out - Clock out officer
- GET /api/duties/recent - Get recent duty records

Location Services:
- POST /api/location/update - Update officer location with geofencing

Personnel Management:
- GET /api/officers/on-duty - Get all on-duty officers
- GET /api/personnel/on-duty - Get personnel overview

Statistics:
- GET /api/stats/supervisor - Supervisor dashboard statistics
- GET /api/stats/sectors - Sector-wise statistics

SOCKET.IO EVENTS
================

Real-time Communication:
- officer-geofence-exit - Triggered when officer leaves geofence
- officer-geofence-enter - Triggered when officer returns to geofence
- officer-location-updated - Broadcasts location updates to supervisors
- supervisor-geofence-alert - High-priority alert for extended violations
- officer-went-off-duty - Removes officer from live map when clocked out

GEOFENCING ALGORITHM
====================

1. Distance Calculation:
   - Uses Haversine formula for accurate geographical distance
   - Calculates distance between current location and assigned duty location
   - 200-meter threshold for geofence boundary

2. State Management:
   - Tracks isOutsideGeofence boolean flag
   - Accumulates timeOutsideGeofenceInSeconds
   - Updates lastLocationTimestamp on each location update

3. Event Triggers:
   - Exit event: When distance > 200m and previously inside
   - Enter event: When distance <= 200m and previously outside
   - Supervisor alert: When time outside >= 600 seconds (10 minutes)
